# Program to demonstrate conditional operator
a, b = 10, 20
 
# Copy value of a in min if a < b else copy b
min = a if a < b else b
 
print(min)

# Python program to demonstrate ternary operator
a, b = 30, 20
 
# Use tuple for selecting an item
# (if_test_false,if_test_true)[test]
# if [a<b] is true it return 1, so element with 1 index will print
# else if [a<b] is false it return 0, so element with 0 index will print
print( (b, a) [a < b] )
 
# Use Dictionary for selecting an item
# if [a < b] is true then value of True key will print
# else if [a<b] is false then value of False key will print
print({True: a, False: b} [a < b])
 
# lambda is more efficient than above two methods
# because in lambda  we are assure that
# only one expression will be evaluated unlike in
# tuple and Dictionary
print((lambda: b, lambda: a)[a < b]())
