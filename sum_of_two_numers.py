a = input("Enter the value of a: ")    # input is used take input from the user
b = input("Enter the value of b: ")    # I am getting input from user as string 
sum = int(a) + int(b)   #int (a) is a type conversion here I am converting string from the user to integer int(a)+int(b) is called concatanation
print(sum)
print(type(sum))
