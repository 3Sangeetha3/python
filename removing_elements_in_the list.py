# Elements can be removed from the List by using the built-in remove()function 
# but an Error arises if the element doesnâ€™t exist in the list. 
# Remove() method only removes one element at a time
# to remove a range of elements, the iterator is used. 
# The remove() method removes the specified item.

# Remove method in List will only remove the first occurrence of the searched element.
